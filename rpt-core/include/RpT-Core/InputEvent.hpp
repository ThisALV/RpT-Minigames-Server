 * @brief Input event, like timer trigger, service request or server termination request

 * those informations.
 *
 * Events are received and emitted by actors. An actor is a connected client who can interferes with server
 * execution, by sending Service Request command, as an example. Each actor is identified with UID, a 64bits unsigned
 * integer.
